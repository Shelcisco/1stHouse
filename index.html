            The first house in a birth chart symbolizes the start of our
            astrological journey, encompassing our physical body and
            appearance, while the last house signifies what lies beneath â€“
            our spirituality. This journey of self-discovery mirrors my own
            experience of rediscovery through the community I found when I
            pursued my passion for skincare. I established The 1st House with
            the aim of sharing the transformative power of skincare with the
            world.
